## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "API Error" Message
**Solution:**
1. Check browser console (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
2. Look for specific error message
3. Common causes:
   - API rate limit hit (wait a few minutes)
   - Model is loading (try again in 20 seconds)
   - Network issue (check connection)

### Generation Takes Forever
**Normal Behavior:**
- HuggingFace free tier can be slow
- First request after idle: 20-60 seconds (model loading)
- Subsequent requests: 10-30 seconds
- **This is expected and FREE!**

### "Model is Loading" Error
**Solution:**
- Wait 20-30 seconds
- Try again
- The model "wakes up" from sleep
- After first successful generation, it's faster

### No Image Appears
**Check:**
1. Did you see "AI Generation Complete!" notification?
2. Look in browser console for errors
3. Try a simpler prompt
4. Check your API key is correct

## üé® What You're Actually Getting

**Important Note:**
- Currently generating **images** (not videos yet)
- This demonstrates the API is working
- In production, you'd use video-specific models
- Video generation requires more compute power

**Why Images First?**
- Text-to-image is faster to test
- Proves API integration works
- Free tier friendly
- Easy to verify results

**To Get Real Videos:**
- Need video-specific HuggingFace models
- Require more compute time (minutes instead of seconds)
- May need paid tier for video models
- Current demo shows the integration works!
