# 🛌 Model Sleep Mode - Quick Guide

## 🎯 **What You're Seeing**

**Error Message:**
```
🛌 Model is in sleep mode. Please wait 1-2 minutes and try again. 
Your first request is waking up the model!
```

---

## ✅ **This is NORMAL and Expected!**

### **Why This Happens:**

HuggingFace's **free tier** puts models to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity to save resources. When you make a request:

1. **First Request** → Wakes up the model (2-3 minutes)
2. **Second Request** → Model is awake! (30 seconds - 1 minute)
3. **Subsequent Requests** → Fast! (10-30 seconds)

---

## 🚀 **SOLUTION - Follow These Steps**

### **Step 1: Make First Request** ✅ (You just did this!)

Your first request is **waking up the model** right now! This is good!

**What happened:**
- ✅ Backend received your request
- ✅ Backend contacted HuggingFace
- ✅ HuggingFace is starting the model
- ⏳ Model needs 2-3 minutes to warm up

---

### **Step 2: Wait 2-3 Minutes** ⏰

**Do this:**
1. Check the time now: _________
2. Wait until: _________ (add 2-3 minutes)
3. Keep the same prompt in the text area
4. Have a coffee ☕ or stretch 🧘

**What's happening behind the scenes:**
```
Your Request → Backend → HuggingFace
                          ↓
                    Model: "Zzz... 😴"
                          ↓
                    Model: "Waking up... 🥱"
                          ↓
                    Model: "Loading... ⚙️"
                          ↓
                    Model: "Ready! ✅"
```

---

### **Step 3: Try Again (Same Prompt)** 🔄

After 2-3 minutes:

1. **Keep the same prompt** (don't change it!)
2. **Click "Generate Video" again**
3. **This time it will work!** ⚡

**Expected result:**
```
✅ Backend connects
✅ Model is awake and ready
✅ Video generates in 30-60 seconds

---

#### **Option C: Use Test Page**

```

**Try there:**

## 🔧 **Technical Details**

### **Backend is Trying 3 Models Automatically**

When you click "Generate Video", the backend tries these in order:

1. **Model 1:** `ali-vilab/text-to-video-ms-1.7b`
   - Status: 😴 Sleeping
   - Waking up: 2-3 minutes

2. **Model 2:** `damo-vilab/text-to-video-ms-1.7b`
   - Status: 😴 Sleeping (backup)
   - Waking up: 2-3 minutes

3. **Model 3:** `camenduru/text2video-zero`
   - Status: 😴 Sleeping (backup)
   - Waking up: 2-3 minutes

**Good news:** Your first request is waking ALL of them up!

---

### **Backend Logs**

Check Terminal 2 (backend), you should see:

```
🎬 Generating video for prompt: "..."
⏳ Requesting from Hugging Face API...
❌ Model not loaded error (503)
💡 Suggestion: The model might be in sleep mode. 
   Try again after 1–2 minutes...
```

This is **expected and correct!**
